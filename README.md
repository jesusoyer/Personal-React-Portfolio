  Hello My name is Jesus Oyervides Jr, I recently graduated from a full-stack development bootcamp. My primary skills as of now are in Javascript, REACT, Node.js and Express.js. I plan in the future on developing a Vue.js portfolio as well as gathering skills in Python. My goal is to gather as much knowledge and skills to create or aid in the development of web applications.
  
 <br> I am currently practicing with React Components while also strengthening my Responsive Web Devlopment skills. I also have been working on Javascript algorithms in LeetCode. 
 
 <br> In my personal life you can find me doing various activities. I love to read books on many different topics, however I would say that I prefer non-fiction books with historical, scientific and sociological topics although I like a good memoir every now and then. I also enjoy physical activities such as lifting weights, bouldering and hiking. You could actually find me in the gym nose deep in a book while taking a stroll on the treadmill. I can also talk your head off when comes to movies, I love diving into the concepts and topics of movies, good or bad I like having something to say about a recently released flick. I would say that the greatest decade of movies has to be the 80's, nothing can top the practicality, originality and  grittiness of them.
